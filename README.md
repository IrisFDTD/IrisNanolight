Scripts:
> **IrisNanolight_1**

+ **IrisNanolight_1** is a Wolfram Mathematica (C) script to characterize the optical properties of Surface Plasmon Polaritons (SPPs) for any metal which dielectric constant has been previously fitted into a Drude-Lorentz model. SPP wavelength, skin-depth and propagation constant is easily obtained. In addition this script allows you to obtain the full band structure of a metal/dielectric interface for rectangular lattices within the 1st Brillouin zone, in the limit of very small scatterers (actually zero size scatters). This version has been checked to work from Mahtematica 8.0 version.  
+ The example included in this version allows you to reproduce several results in Ref. [1]. That work was conducted in context of Extraordinary optical transmission (EOT) research [2]. Roughly speaking, EOT is a family of EM resonances through subwavelength apertures, in either a flat or a corrugated metallic film. These resonances provide high transmission of light, much more that would be expected for such tiny apertures as compared to the wavelength of light [3]. EOT was discovered in 1998 [4] and since then it has been a very active research field, leading both to the discovery of new ways of enhancing the optical transmission and to its application to sensing, color filters, metamaterials, lenses, optical trapping, enhancement of nonlinear effects, among others [5]. <img style="float: right;" width="400" src="./HA_geometry.png">
+ Within a single run of **IrisNanolight_1** you get in C:\ (dir by default):
 + *eps.dat*: gives the dielectric constant used in the script. In the example provided it is done for silver, while other important metals in Nanophotonics can be used using fittings of Table I in Ref.[1]. Check the result with Fig.1 in [1].
 + *SPP_properties.dat*: provides SPP wavelength, its progataion length and skin-depth, as a function of the wavelength. Check the result with Fig.2 in [1]. Spectral dependence for different metals
 + *BS_p=...nm.dat*: provides the SPP band structure in the $\Sigma-X-M$ directions of the first Brillouin zone for the dielectric-silver interface (glass as substrate). The dispersion relation of the SPP is arbitrarly folded for a period $P=500$nm. Check the result with the solid red line shown in Fig.6 in [1].
 + See the script for further details.
